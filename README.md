# React Shopping List


## Description
Created a shopping list to help people keep track of the list of what they want to buy and mark them as purchsed or delete them off their list.

## Installations
- Run npm install for dependencies
- Run npm run server
- Run npm run client
- Navigate to localhost:3000

- Create database and table
1. If you would like to name your database something else, you will need to change untitled_table to the name of your new database name in server/modules/pool.js
2. The queries in the database.sql file are set up to create all the necessary tables. The project is built on Postgres, so you will need to make sure to have that installed. Use your client of choice to run the queries.

## Additional Information
Worked on this project with two of my classmate Nick Bares and Hunter Webster, during the EmEmerging Digital Academy Boot-camp.
